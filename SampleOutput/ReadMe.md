# ReadMe

This folder should be empty, except for this ReadMe.md file.

In the DataFabricatorUsage.ps1 file (found in the root file) I have a few examples of exporting data to files. To keep the other folders from getting cluttered, I have directed the output to this SampleOutput folder.

If you choose to download the code and play with the commands in DataFabricatorUsage.ps1, you can safely delete any files in this folder (except for this ReadMe) when you are done.

See the [DataFabricator](./../Documentation/DataFabricator.md) document for more information on the overall structure of the code.

See the [DataFabricator File Structure](./../Documentation/DataFabricator-FileStructure.md) document for more information on the file structure for the modules code base.
